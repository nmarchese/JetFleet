Homework assignment

This program displays a menu for managing a fleet of aircraft. The main is in FleetMenu, which displays the menu and accepts user input to navigate and make changes.

The Jet class has Jet constructors that require important details, but can be used without all details.

The Fleet class stores the array that the jets are put into when they are constructed. Within the Fleet class there are getters and setters to pull information or update the array with new Jets.

The Pilot class generates randomized pilots with a constructor. Pilots are constructed only when a new plane is created and assigned directly to that new plane.
